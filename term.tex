In table .... the term 'Effect' denotes the effect of different terms on the particular 
response (expressed in the coded form). The term 'Coef' stands for the coefficients of the 
coded form of equations, corresponding to the uncoded form of equations, related to a specific 
response. It represents the relationship between the factors and the said response. The term 
'SE Coeff' indicates the standard error for the estimated coefficient, which measures the precision 
of the estimate. The 'T' value determines the ratio of corresponding value under coefficient and 
standard error. On the other hand, the 'p' value is the minimum value for a value for a pre-set level 
of significance, at which the hypothesis of equal means for a given factor is rejected.
